First of all, install Node Package Manager in all three directories: Root/Main, Frontend, and Backend. 
Then come back to the root directory. To run the project, I have utilized the ‘concurrently’ package which allows both the frontend and backend to start simultaneously.
To execute this, run the following command: ‘npm run start’. 
Some of the features are available after login of User, while others are available after login as Admin.
Admin Auth: Email: coderfounded@gmail.com 
Pass: Coderfounded16@. Data Base info is on the app.js file in the backend.
The login auth of cloud database is set up with one of my gmail accounts.
so 1st login this gmail in Google then you can access database account on clicking sign in with google directly.
coderfounded@gmail.com
Pass: Coderfounded16@

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other inconvenience.
